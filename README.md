# aminal-shelter
Learning project, largely following [MongoDB's guide](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial) for now. Made after talking to an animal shelter employee about the need for better databases there.

TODO:
* [Update ReactDOM.render to createRoot](https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot).
* Remove hardcoding on animal form, better typing
